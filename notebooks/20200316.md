This is my first jupyter notebook using VS Code!
I really don't know what I'm doing, but here we go!

For this first project, I want to make a converter that converts someone's age into months using their birthdate.
From there I'd like to make the program use user input.
After that I'd like to try and make it a web-based app that can be used online.

My initial searches on Google have lead me to the datetime module.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#module-datetime

Hopefully I'll be able to find enough information here to get started.


```python
import datetime
```

So I don't actually know the proper definiton of a python module.  

After searching for it, from the offical python documentation I found: </b><i>A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.</i></b> https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html
